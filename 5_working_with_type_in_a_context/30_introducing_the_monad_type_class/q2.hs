-- Q30.2 To prove that Monad is strictly more powerful than Applicative, write a universal version of <*>,
--   called allApp, that defines <*> for all members of the Monad type class.
--   Because it works for all instances of Monad, the only functions you can use are the meth- ods required by the
--   Monad type class (and lambda functions). To get you started, hereâ€™s your type signature:
--
--   allApp :: Monad m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
--
--   This question is much trickier than the last one. Two hints:
--
--   - Try to think exclusively in terms of the type signatures.
--   - Use <$> if you want and replace it with your answer to Q29.1

allApp :: Monad m => m (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
allApp func val = func >>= (\f -> val >>= (\x -> return (f x)) )
