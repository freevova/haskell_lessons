-- Q11.3 Recall myFoldl from lesson 9.
--   myFoldl f init [] = init
--   myFoldl f init (x:xs) = myFoldl f newInit xs
--     where newInit = f init x
--
--   What’s the type signature of this function? Note: foldl has a different type signature.

myFoldl :: (a -> b) -> a -> [a] -> b
myFoldl f init [] = init
myFoldl f init (x:xs) = myFoldl f newInit xs
  where newInit = f init x
