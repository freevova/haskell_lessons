-- Q22.1 Write a program, simple_calc.hs, that reads simple equations involving adding
--   two numbers or multiplying two numbers. The program should solve the equation each
--   user types into each line as each line is entered.

-- Q22.2 Write a program that allows a user to select a number between 1 and 5 and then
--   prints a famous quote (quotes are of your choosing). After printing the quote, the pro-
--   gram will ask whether the user would like another. If the user enters n, the program
--   ends; otherwise, the user gets another quote. The program repeats until the user enters
--   n. Try to use lazy evaluation and treat the user input as a list rather than recursively
--   calling main at the end.
