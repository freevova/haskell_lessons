-- Q10.1 Use map on a list of robot objects to get the life of each robot in the list.

-- Q10.2 Write a threeRoundFight function that takes two robots and has them fight
--   for three rounds, returning the winner. To avoid having so many different variables for robot state,
--   use a series of nested lambda functions so you can just overwrite robotA and robotB.

-- Q10.3 Create a list of three robots.
--   Then create a fourth robot.
--   Use partial application to create a closure for the fight method so
--   the fourth robot can fight all three robots at once, using map.
--   Finally, use map to get the remaining life from the rest of the robots.
